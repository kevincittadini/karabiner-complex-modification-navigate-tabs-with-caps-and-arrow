# karabiner-complex-modification-navigate-tabs-with-caps-and-arrow

### For macOS users
This _Karabiner Complex Modification_ that will allow you to navigate through tabs using Caps Lock + Arrows instead of LCommand+LAlt+Any arrow

This is really useful if you're using an external keyboar.
I've been having hardare/compatibility issues holding LCmd and LAlt at the same time.

### Installation 

You need to use the following URL to let Karabiner import this local file with the complex modification.

```
karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=file%3A%2F%2F%path%2Fto%2Ffile%2Fkarabiner.json
```
